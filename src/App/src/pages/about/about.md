I architect, build, and scale modern web ecosystems that don’t just work — they *work well together*.

At Milwaukee Tool, I’m helping reshape how a global brand delivers digital experiences — designing scalable patterns, unifying frontend systems, and mentoring engineers to think not just about code, but about context. My focus is clean architecture, strong contracts, resilient systems, and empowering teams through clarity, not complexity.

I believe in architecture as a conversation — one where good patterns create space for velocity, not restriction. I love working where strategy meets execution and ideas become systems teams can grow with.

On the side, I'm experimenting with:
- An AI assistant using GPT + Whisper
- Self-healing systems with Azure Container Apps + OpenTelemetry
- Astro + dotnet to push the boundaries of web app development

My goal: build something simple for developers and meaningful for users.
