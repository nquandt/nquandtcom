Senior Software Engineer with an architectural grasp and a passion for building scalable, high-impact digital products. I approach software with a systems-level mindset, balancing big-picture architecture with hands-on development. Skilled in Azure, modern languages and frameworks, and agile delivery, I blend engineering depth with product intuition to build solutions that are maintainable, performant, and user-focused. Detail-oriented, collaborative, and driven by continuous growth, I thrive on solving complex problems that create real-world value.
