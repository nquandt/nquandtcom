- Define and lead architectural strategy for www.milwaukeetool.com and its ecosystem of digital products, aligning implementation decisions with long-term scalability, performance, and brand fidelity.
- Design a multi-region, BFF-style API Gateway architecture using .NET, YARP, and Azure Front Door, enabling centralized routing, Redis-backed session auth, regional failover, smart routing, and zero-downtime A/B testing.
- Champion a vertical-slice architecture, evolving monolithic applications into independently deployable, plugin-based digital products with clearly bounded domains and service contracts.
- Pilot and scale a shared React design system grounded in atomic design principles, Tailwind CSS, and Storybook, now adopted across 6+ digital products for consistent, reusable UI components.
- Develop an internal ASP.NET Core service framework to bootstrap containerized apps with built-in support for Azure Key Vault, App Configuration, and dynamic updates via Event Grid.
- Lead the migration to centralized configuration and secrets management using Azure App Configuration and Key Vault, enabling secure, environment-specific deployments and real-time config updates.
- Integrate Statsig feature flags into our .NET + React stack, aligning experimentation with analytics and user segmentation to reduce release risk and improve product validation.
- Spearheaded the development of an internal gpt-4-turbo powered assistant using Semantic Kernel, designed to augment sales reps with product, support, and troubleshooting knowledge on the floor.
- Advocate and implement standardized observability using OpenTelemetry and New Relic, delivering consistent tracing, metrics, and logging across the application landscape.
- Establish cross-team standards for dependency injection, modular architecture, error handling, and telemetry — enabling a shared engineering culture around maintainable, observable, and resilient code.
- Provide architectural guidance, starter kits, and documentation to greenfield projects, ensuring rapid alignment to system strategy while minimizing knowledge silos.
- Advise teams on .NET architecture aligned with Microsoft’s Modern Web App Pattern and Azure Well-Architected Framework, geared toward elevating performance, reliability, and maintainability across services.
- Mentor engineers through PR reviews, architecture sessions, and one-on-one guidance, fostering a culture of shared ownership, context-first decision-making, and long-term maintainability.
